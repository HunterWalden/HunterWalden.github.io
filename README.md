  <h3 align="center">My Capstone Project</h3>

  <p align="center">
    This github.io website contains my capstone project from my time at Southern New Hampshire University. The assignment was to take a project from a previous class and enhance it in three areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
    <br /><br />
    I chose a project from my Data Structures and Algorithms class that read a .csv file containing bids on various items. I enhanced the project by reorganizing the code into proper header and cpp files, adding new functionality, and converting the .csv storage to an SQLite database.
    <br /><br />
    More information on my enhancements, including an initial code review, can be found at <a href="https://hunterwalden.github.io/SNHUCapstone">the GitHub Pages website</a>.
